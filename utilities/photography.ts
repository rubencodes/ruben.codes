  pageText: "My name is Ruben Martinez Jr. I'm a New York City based photographer and software engineer. My artistic interests are mainly around capturing portraits, both in the studio and out in the real world. I most often shoot with my Sony A7RIV mirrorless camera, and I prefer to shoot with a macro lens to capture more intimately framed shots. Check out my photo galleries via the link above, and feel free to contact me if you see anything you like or if you'd be interested in collaborating on a shoot."
